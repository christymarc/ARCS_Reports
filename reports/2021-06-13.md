# Activities

* Edited the output of the pytorch model when training to include times and when going through the validation set to include class accuracy
* Put everything on the GPU to increase training speed
* Fixed pytorch model validation set (using argmax instead of torch.max)
* Tested different learning rates
* Added initial weights to pytorch model
* Fixed issue with splitting the dataset in pytorch model
* Made models with different hidden layers (dropout layers/batch normalization)
  * Tested how the layers affected performance in the maze
* Read OpenBot paper
* Began reading paper on dropout layers

# Issues

* Server issues this week
* Still having issues with cnn_learner for fastai model

# Plans

* Need to train models on more image data
  * Generate more mazes, use edited autogen to generate more image data with proper labels
* Try out different resnets
* Try out different initial weights
* Try to get fastai model working better
* Interested in maybe trying some data augmentation, differing lighting, etc.
* Continue working through fastai course
