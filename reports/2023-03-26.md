# Activities

* Used this guide https://compusciencing.github.io/how-to-write-a-post.html to update https://compusciencing.github.io/unrealcv-ue5-windows.html to note the following:
  * connect client and make requests to client while ue5 project is in PLAY mode (can test with client.request('vget /objects') request)
  * if having an issue with port, search 'Port' using 'search log' in the 'output log' section of ue5 and use whatever port it specifies using as default
  * if you get an error about port usage (like port is already in use), do this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39632667/how-do-i-kill-the-process-currently-using-a-port-on-localhost-in-windows and close+reopen ue5
* Planning to meet with Simon when he gets back from vacation
