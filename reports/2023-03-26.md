# Activities

* Used this guide https://compusciencing.github.io/how-to-write-a-post.html to update https://compusciencing.github.io/unrealcv-ue5-windows.html to note the following:
  * connect client and make requests to client while ue5 project is in PLAY mode (can test with client.request('vget /objects') request)
  * if having an issue with port, search 'Port' using 'search log' in the 'output log' section of ue5 and use whatever port it specifies using as default
  * if you get an error about port usage (like port is already in use), do this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39632667/how-do-i-kill-the-process-currently-using-a-port-on-localhost-in-windows and close+reopen ue5
* Brought unreal environment from the server into the lab computer
* Updated boxnav with porting fix and readme edits
* Planning to meet with Simon when he gets back from vacation 

# Issues

* lab computer is associated with Oliver's github, commits from computer use his account...
  * solution attempt: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44494410/why-github-shows-someone-else-commit-to-my-repository-but-it-was-done-by-myself
  * solution attempt: https://medium.com/@devesu/how-to-logout-from-git-in-windows-e17c66fe9ca8
  * solution: reclone repo to reset github settings
* UE5 oldy environment does not load in properly, errors regarding settings and "level script blueprint references streamed actor"
  * solution: [Untick the "is Spacially Loaded" box of the element causing the error]https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/map-check-error-level-script-blueprint-refrences-streamed-actor/534202/7

# Plans

  * install fast ai (note in readme)
  * make port parameter
  * need trained model (train model with oldytraining repo)
  * images: /data/clark/data/2ndRunHighRes
* attempt to begin inference in ue5
