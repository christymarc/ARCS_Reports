# Activities
* setting up adversarial example generation with cleverhans library
* fixing error in cleverhans cw pytorch implementation
* setting up adversarial training

# Issues
* In CW implementation, modifier = torch.zeros_like(x, requires_grad=True) creating a non-leaf tensor...so when the optimizer is called on [modifier], an error comes up that says cannot optimize a non-leaf tensor
  * [zeros_like documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.zeros_like.html)  
  * when I switch to torch.zeros, it returns a leaf
