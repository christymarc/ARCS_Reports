# Activities

[List of items you worked on since our last meeting--all accomplishments and concepts/lessons learned. Some weeks there may not be anyâ€”-that's OK.  
Including plots, images or videos is great.]
* Continued work on FASTAI course, completing lesson 4. 
  * Learned about creating NNs from scratch (hand-written digit classification)
* Created model that takes previous move into account 
  * Wrote Pytorch version and FastAI version
  * Created own dataset class
  * Learned more about FastAI's functionality as well as limitations
    * Learned about different samplers, loss functions, FastAI's learner class
    * Learned about FastAI's way of adding onto pretrained models and how to go about training custom models
* Installed the Black autoformatter
* Rewrote Example-FastAI-Marchese notebook for new models and ran the models through the maze

# Issues

* Had a lot of issues getting FastAI to run -> issues with dataset, dataloader, sampler, cnn_learner, etc.
  * These were mostly resolved. Found out because cnn_learner already adds new layers and trains them automatically, putting custom models into it doesn't
  really work. I needed to use the learner class
* Issue exporting models in FastAI, giving the following error: "'ImageWithCmdDataset' object has no attribute 'new_empty'"
  * Exporting in pytorch worked fine
* Both models only predict straight moves :(

# Plans

* Fix the models
* See if I can figure out the exporting issue 
# Continue working through FastAI course
