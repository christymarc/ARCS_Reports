# Activities

* Put together camera parts
* Helped build new PC
* Looked at different parameters for RNNs (LSTM layers, channels)
  * Channels exceeding 15 run into memory problems
  * good number of layers: 6 (best performance with the models)
    * FAI model with 15 channels and 6 layers completed the maze
    * Torch model with 10 channels and 6 layers completed the maze

# Issues

* RNNs still not exceeding 87% accuracy

# Plans

* cut spacers
* Look at getting my models to work on Imitator file
