# Activities

* Looked into different camera-based motion capture systems
  * vicon, optitrack, azure kinect, low cost system with other cameras, etc.  
* Connected to JetBot and looked at tutorial notebooks to learn how to control bot from notebooks

# Issues
* Need to find a way to capture error of actual movement...motor package -> _observe_value? 
  * Jetbot doesn't have motor encoders...need to either install some, figure out how jetbot self-corrects in code, or wait until motion capture system comes in  

# Plans
* Make MFAC (find a way to capture error -> look more at the github)
* Compare camera specs of the motion capture systems (vicon vera, vicon vantage, optitrack prime, etc.)
