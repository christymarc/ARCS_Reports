# Activities

* Looked into different camera-based motion capture systems
* Connected to JetBot and looked at tutorial notebooks to learn how to control bot from notebooks

# Issues
* Need to find a way to capture error of actual movement...motor package -> _observe_value?

# Plans
* Make MFAC (find a way to capture error -> look more at the github)
