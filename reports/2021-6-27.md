# Activities

* Finished testing different CNN pretrained architectures: Dense Nets (121, 161, 169, 201), Squeeze Nets (1_0, 1_1), ResneXts (50, 101)
  * The models trained in Fastai generally did the best with only the fastai squeeze nets not being able to complete the test maze
  * With models trained in torch, their performances seemed a bit more variable with only the torch squeezenet1_1, densenet121, and resneXt101 completing the mazes
    * the torch densenet121 did the best of all models by the metric of steps
* Went through CAD/Fusion360 tutorials to learn how to use the software (made a kettle with a strainer and a stamp)
* Designed new camera encasements for the Jetson Nano via CAD
* Chose spacers that would work for the new encasement

# Issues

* Issue exporting dxf file of encasement parts to Prof Clark 

# Plans

* Get export of dxf to work properly
* Start working with electronics
* Create RNN
