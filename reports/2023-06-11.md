## Unreal Engine Related Articles
### [Real Shading in Unreal Engine 4](https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/Resources/files/2013SiggraphPresentationsNotes-26915738.pdf)
* Article and presentation goes over major improvements made the Unreal Engine 4s rendering of light/shading with respect to differing materials, etc.

### [BenchBot: Evaluating Robotics Research in Photorealistic 3D Simulation and on Real Robots](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.00635.pdf)
* Intent: standardize evaluation and streamline robotics research by providing software that empowers the research process
* software tool for comprehensively evaluating the performance of novel robotics research in both high-fidelity 3D simulation and on real robots
* built on top of NVIDIA's [Isaac Unreal Engine simulator](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/industries/robotics/) to provide ease of lighting changes, realistic simulation generation, etc.
* enables users to go through each step of research process, posing a problem environment (generation of environment according to nature of the problem), solution iteration/research, evaluation (these metrics are standardized to promote a standardized metric system of robot research experiments), comprehensive profile
  * the profile gives info of the robots performance in diff environments, platforms, and transferability to real-world environments

### [AirSim: High-Fidelity Visual and Physical Simulation for Autonomous Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.05065.pdf)
* Intent: build a high-fidelity, open-source simulation on top of Unreal Engine 4 (called AirSim) that enables more realistic simulated environments for autonomous vehicle model data collection such as a quadrotor
* AirSim API design allows developing algorithms against simulator and then deploy them without change on real vehicles
* The physics simulation is a plugin for unreal engine and extends its functionality through adding gravity, air density, air pressure, Earth's magnetic field
  * also includes consideration for acceleration, collisions, and linear+angular drag
  * sensors like an accelerometer, gyroscope, barometer, magnetometer and GPS
* missing application for advanced ground vehicles + methods of noise introduction

### [Gibson Env: Real-World Perception for Embodied Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.10654.pdf)
* intent: existing algs to slow to learn in real time, robots fragile and costly, so wanting to create [Gibson](https://svl.stanford.edu/igibson/) physics simulation environment that mimics real world perception for embodied agents to address the reality gap, virtualizing the real-world to reflect its complexities
* utilizes a neural network rendering approach to bridge the gap between real life camera images and Gibson's images in the simulated real-life space 
  * effectively creating a kind of glasses for the agent in the Gibson env that are used to bridge the reality gap through usign a NN to fill in missing components (enhance rendering) and jointly training a backward function to transition real environments to simulated environments (Note: maybe this would also be worth exploring....)
* Gibson’s underlying database of spaces includes 572 full buildings composed of 1447 floors covering a total area of 211k m2s
* scans are rendered to point clouds, project it onto a equirectangular image, depth test+filter, bilinear interpolation to reduce empty space, then a neural network, or “filler”, to fix artifacts and generate a more real looking image given the output of geometric point cloud rendering
  * use dilated convolutions to fill in missing information (aggregate contexual information -- this is really cool...maybe can use for object absense/removal that may pertain to adversarial example generation) 
* supports arbitrary agents with URDFs
* integrates PID controller, ideal positional controller, and Nonholonomic controller
* beyond RGB channel rendering also channels for rendering depth, surface normals, and semantic
* Limits: no dynamic content (moving beings), no full material properties and incomplete physics simulation, goggles hasn't been tested on a real-world agent
