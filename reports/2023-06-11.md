### [BenchBot: Evaluating Robotics Research in Photorealistic 3D Simulation and on Real Robots](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.00635.pdf)
* Intent: standardize evaluation and streamline robotics research by providing software that empowers the research process
* software tool for comprehensively evaluating the performance of novel robotics research in both high-fidelity 3D simulation and on real robots
* built on top of NVIDIA's [Isaac Unreal Engine simulator](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/deep-learning-ai/industries/robotics/) to provide ease of lighting changes, realistic simulation generation, etc.
* enables users to go through each step of research process, posing a problem environment (generation of environment according to nature of the problem), solution iteration/research, evaluation (these metrics are standardized to promote a standardized metric system of robot research experiments), comprehensive profile
  * the profile gives info of the robots performance in diff environments, platforms, and transferability to real-world environments

### [AirSim: High-Fidelity Visual and Physical Simulation for Autonomous Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.05065.pdf)
* Intent: build a high-fidelity, open-source simulation on top of Unreal Engine 4 (called AirSim) that enables more realistic simulated environments for autonomous vehicle model data collection such as a quadrotor
* AirSim API design allows developing algorithms against simulator and then deploy them without change on real vehicles
* The physics simulation is a plugin for unreal engine and extends its functionality through adding gravity, air density, air pressure, Earth's magnetic field
  * also includes consideration for acceleration, collisions, and linear+angular drag
  * sensors like an accelerometer, gyroscope, barometer, magnetometer and GPS
* missing application for advanced ground vehicles + methods of noise introduction
