# Activities
* Fixed FGSM implementation because noticed the clamp was clamping to the wrong range of numbers

# Issues
* N/A

# Plans
* see if cleverhans library can be implemented
* start implementing CW + PGD

# Paper Summaries
## [Test-time Detection and Repair of Adversarial Samples via Masked Autoencoder](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12848.pdf)
* Test-time defenses: defenses to evasion attacks that detect at test-time
* They propose DRAM: using MAE (masked autoencoder) they detect and repair adversarial attacks
    * MAE: A Masked Autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network architecture used in unsupervised machine learning and neural network-based dimensionality reduction techniques. It is designed to learn a compact representation of the input data by encoding the data into a lower-dimensional representation and then decoding it back into its original form
    * detect: "We leverage MAE to detect adversarial samples generated from potentially unforeseen attacks via a statistic-based test on the MAE loss." aka looking at reconstruction loss
    * repair: "minimizing MAE loss at run-time"
