# Activities

* Helped finish new PC
* Put together camera parts for Jetson
* Looked at different parameters for RNNs (LSTM layers, channels, batch sizes)
  * Found batch sizes of 32 work the best 
  * Channels exceeding 15 run into memory problems
  * good number of LSTM layers: 6 (best performance with the models)
    * FAI model with 15 hidden channels and 6 layers completed the maze
    * Torch model with 10 hidden channels and 6 layers completed the maze
* Learned how to solder, started to put together roboclaw wiring

# Issues

* RNNs still not exceeding 87% accuracy on validation set (may not be meaningful)

# Plans

* cut spacers
* Look at getting my models to work on Imitator file
