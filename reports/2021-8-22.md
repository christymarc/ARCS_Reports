# Activities

* Finished training corrected-wander-full and uniform-full models
* Finished training all RNN, hybrid, stacked, paneled, and regression models
* Ran RNN, hybrid, stacked, paneled, and regression through imitator -> normal texture
* Ran RNNs and hybrid models through imitator with brick texture
* Obtained imitator data for all models
* Plotted data for models

# Issues

* Stacked and paneled models not able to get validation data
* Regression model underperformed from previous tests, all variations of regression performed the same -> suspicious
* Stacked and paneled models performed terribly -> different than previous tests
* Stacked, paneled, and regression models removed from first draft of paper due to unusually poor results that couldn't be substantiated

# Plans

* Eventually fix problem with stacked, paneled, and regression models
* Run RNNs and hybrids through more mazes
