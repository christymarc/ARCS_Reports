Comparison and benchmarking of AI Models and Frameworks on Mobile Devices

* Note: I think this paper is a good reference for describing different network architectures (good visual and textual descriptions): ResNet, Inception, DenseNet, SqueezeNet. Also good to see how their comparison of these architectures compares with our comparison.

Summary: The researchers developed AIoTBench a benchmark suite which evaluates the performances of 6 different network architectures developed through 3 different deep learning frameworks and deployed on 5 different mobile devices. The networks were evaluated by the metric of accuracy, valid images per second (VIPS) (a user level metric of how many images can be processed per second), and valid FLOPS per second (VOPS) (a system-level metric of how much the system can compute per second). The networks were tasked with image classification, trained on 1,280,000 images with 1000 classes, and validated on 5000 images (5 from each class). The paper gives a good summary of each network architecture they used including how they differ from the other architectures. The data was normalized, channels were rearranged per architecture, and images were resized. The researchers found taht across different mobile platforms, performance and accuracy differed. They also found that different AI framworks worked differently on each device and that there wasn't one definitiive answer for which network worked the best. Accuracy wise, the ranking went (from best to worst): InceptionV3, Resnet50, MnasNet, DenseNet121, MobileNetV2, and SqueezeNet (this one doing significantly worse than the others).
