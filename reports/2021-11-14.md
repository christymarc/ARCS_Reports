## Enhancing a Model-Free Adaptive Controller through Evolutionary Computation

Notes:
* MFAC controller learns how to control a device by continually updating the link weights of an artificial neural network (ANN). Moreover, by saving recent error signals and using them as additional inputs to the ANN, MFAC controllers take advantage of state information, or so-called neural network memory
  * using MFAC with proportional control
  * reliance on a model of the target system makes it difficult for it to adapt to new terrain not in training
* Uses the coupling of evolutionary computation with model-free adaptive control. Specifically, the diferential evolution (DE) algorithm is used to find good MFAC controller parameters that enable a robot to adapt during its lifetime to changes such as mechanical wear and material degradation
* The final output of the controller is the sum of the value from a single output neuron and the current error signal amplified by the controller gain
