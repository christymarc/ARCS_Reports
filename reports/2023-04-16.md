# Activities
* pushed changes to oldenborg training repo -- including script to auto-train models and edited training.py
* beginning inference
  * exporting models to local computer, running them with inference.py from OldenborgTraining repo  
  * write into inference.py 
    * check for screenshots directory - error if it exists
    * go through all images in screenshots -> adding numbers 00000-etc
    * rename screenshot directory with time and date

# Issues
* from fastai.vision.all import * -> gives "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'torchvision.models.utils'" error
  * solution: [upgraded fastai](https://forums.fast.ai/t/modulenotfounderror-no-module-named-fastai-vision-all-on-kaggle-notebook/77008)
* "NotImplementedError: cannot instantiate 'PosixPath' on your system"
  * solution: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57286486/i-cant-load-my-model-because-i-cant-put-a-posixpath
* Error as image path was being sent in for the inference images but no images were being saved in the repository
  * solution: 
    * Simon's UE5EnvWrapper relies on a UE5 blueprint in the OldenborgUE project file -> this file isn't actually in the OldenborgUE5 project, apparently never pushed...
    * I edited Simon's UE5EnvWrapper to instead send to the project the command line argument to take a screenshot: 
      * [vrun HighResShot 1](http://docs.unrealcv.org/en/latest/reference/commands.html)
    * was able to find where ue5 stores screenshots taken: in project folder -> Saved -> Screenshots
    * And found out that once the image file path is sent in as the path, the inference.py works

## Notes on HighResShot
* "The default behavior is to take a screenshot with a resolution 4 times greater than the game resolution and create an image file in the Screenshot folder."
* HighResShot XxY -> ex: HighResShot 360x360 takes a 360x360 resolution screenshot
* HighRestShot multiplier -> HighResShot 2 -> takes a screenshot 2x the set resolution of the project
* [more info on HighResShot command](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/taking-screenshots-in-unreal-engine/)
