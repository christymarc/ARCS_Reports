# Activities
* Tried to fix accuracy issue
* Comparing fastai learner.predict(data) to pytorch learner.model(data)
    * saw that there was not a significant difference between the accuracy of these (very much below, accuracy during training)
    * potentially difference between dataloaders is the issue? <new dataloader>.train versus learner.dls.valid
        * maybe some automatic transforms that they do on the images and for some reason they're different?
     
# Issues
* continuing accuracy issue

# Activities
* continue working through issue
* lit review
* begin implementing CW and/or look into [adversarial generation attack repo](https://github.com/cleverhans-lab/cleverhans/tree/master)
