# Activities

* Continued training models (non-pretrained)
* Read papers and wrote summaries
* Continued writing paper (methods and abstract)
* Began writing script for training prev cmd models

# Issues

* Ran into error in running prev cmd script -> a file doesn't exist so the models can't train...

# Plans

* Continue writing and editing paper
* Fix issues with the training prev cmd model script
* Change RNN script so that it runs with the data from raid

## Convolutional LSTM Network: A Machine Learning Approach for Precipitation Nowcasting

Note: This paper goes into the development of the ConvLSTM network, which we used in our RNN model. The paper is also helpful for understanding when LSTMs may come in handy,
possible justifications as to why they do better than other models, and how LSTMs work.

Summary: The goal of this paper was to address how an LSTM RNN network with convolutional features could be used to address the issue of predicting rainfall intensity over
a short period of time (precipitation nowcasting). In evaluating their trained convLSTM, the researchers compared the model's performance to an FC-LSTM and the commonly used
ROVER algorithm. The convLSTM, at each output of the data, produces 3D tensors from 3D tensor input. This functionality allows the LSTM to maintain spacial features of the
data, which would usually be lost. The loss function used for training was cross-entropy loss. The metrics the models were compared by were rainfall mean squared error,
critical success index, false alarm, rate, probability of detection, and correlation. 

Through testing on the Moving-MNIST dataset and the Radar Echo dataset the researchers found:
* The convLSTM is better than FC-LSTM in handling spaciotemporal correlations
* Making the size of state-to-state convolutional kernel bigger than 1 is essential for capturing the spatiotemporal motion patterns
* Deeper models can produce better results with fewer parameters (since the higher the layer, the more scope of the input it can see)
* ConvLSTM performs better than ROVER for precipitation nowcasting
* The convLSTM is able to handle boundary conditions well because if the network has seen similar patterns during training, it can discover this type of sudden changes in
  the encoding network and give reasonable predictions in the forecasting network
