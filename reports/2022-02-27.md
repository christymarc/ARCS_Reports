# Activities

* Reviewed MFAC material, attempted to write up MFAC code
* Looked into physics sim code and animating it
* Looked into jetbot encoders, to see if able to install 

# Issues

* Seemingly no straightforward way to attach new encoders to jetbot
* Issue installing tnker of the server, so couldn't use turtle -> now going to use matplotlib animation

# Plans

* Start coding and graphing physics sim for MFAC application, animate with matplotlib, start MFAC code in PyTorch (...for now)
