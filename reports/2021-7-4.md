# Activities

* Fixed Example-FastAI-Marchese (broke with new edits Prof Clark pushed)
* Made Recurrent Neural Network in torch and fastai
  * Had to fix autogen_Marchese (broke with new edits Prof Clark pushed)
   * Coded matplotlib animation notebook to see what was the issue with the model and try to understand why it was producing thousands of images for each maze
  * Fixed autogen and made labelling appropriate for RNN to ensure sequential order (#####-MOVE-PREVMOVE.png)
  * Seemingly not really doing so well in training, barely able to exceed 80% accuracy on validation set
* Finalized CAD designed after making small changes, aligning, and ensuring pieces fit together
* Got dxf export to work
* Had a much appreciated electronics lesson, learning basic circuit theory laws
* Applied laws to breadboard/arduino example with LED lights, resistors, and a powersource (using a multimeter to observe numeric drops in voltage across the circuits)
* Updated bootloaders of 2 "broken" arduinos via this website's instructions https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360012048060-How-to-burn-the-bootloader-between-two-Arduino-Mega
* Helped build new PC

# Issues

* Example-FastAI-Marchese's kernal would shutdown whenever I tried to run env.reset()
* Ran into certain problems in developing RNN such as the issue with autogen and it breaking/producing thousands of images from single mazes because it was not able to navigate the maze autonomously anymore

# Plans

* Finish building the PC
* Continue trying to improve the RNN
* Do some fun project with the arduinos
