## PID Without a PHD

Notes:
* Control loops:  Some command is given to a controller, and the controller determines a drive signal to be applied to the plant. In response to being driven, the plant responds with some behavior. In a closed-loop control system such as a PID loop, the plant behavior is measured, and this measurement is fed back to the controller, which uses it along with the command to determine the plant drive
