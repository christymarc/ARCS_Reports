## PID Without a PHD

Notes:
* Control loops:  Some command is given to a controller, and the controller determines a drive signal to be applied to the plant. In response to being driven, the plant responds with some behavior. In a closed-loop control system such as a PID loop, the plant behavior is measured, and this measurement is fed back to the controller, which uses it along with the command to determine the plant drive.
* control system's “step response”: the behavior of the system output in response to an input that goes from zero to some constant value at time t = 0
  * step response of motor: starts out slowly due to the time constant, but once that is out of the way the motor position ramps at a constant velocity

  * step response of precision actuator (a freely moving mechanical stage, a speaker coil (a coil and magnet arrangement) and a non-contact position transducer): shaped like a parabola -- sluggishness with which the stage starts moving, and its enthusiasm to keep moving once it gets going

  * step response of heating system:  The response tends to settle out to a constant temperature for a given drive but it can take a great deal of time doing it and has responses to ambient temperature which move the temperature of the system up

* PID = "Proportional, Integral, Derivative"
  * The plant feedback is subtracted from the command signal to generate an error. This error signal drives the proportional and integral elements. The derivative element is driven only from plant feedback.
* A proportional controller is just the error signal multiplied by a constant and fed out to the drive (deals with present behavior)
  * Plants that have too much delay, like the precision actuator, can’t be stabilized with proportional control. Some plants, likethe temperature controller, cannot be brought to the desired set point. Plants like the motor and gear combination may work, but they may need to be driven faster than is possible with proportional control alone
* Integral control: add long-term precision to a control loop (by itself destroys stability) -> remembers what went on before but always adjusts too late (deals with past behavior)
* Proportional-Integral control: combines the steady state improvements of integral control with the improvements of proportional control.
  * motor: slightly over then levels out to desired speed
  * heater: settles out 2 to 3 times faster
  * Problem -> If you use a PI controller, then all the time spent in saturation can cause the integrator state to grow (wind up) to very large values. When the plant reaches the target, the integrator value is still very large, so the plant drives beyondthe target while the integrator unwinds and the process reverses. This situation can get so bad that the system never settles out, but just slowly oscillates around the target position 
  * have system, each sample ±1% to ±5 of the correct sample time
* if you cannot stabilize a plant with proportional control you cannot stabilize it with PI control
* Derivative control:  last value of the position minus the current value of the position; predicts the behavior of the plant (deals with future behavior)
  * actuator with PD: settles in 1/2 second (faster than all others)
  * heater with PID: also improves
  * even sampling essential!!!!
* Good starting val for proportional gain is 1/100 of the derivative gain value
* Start with about 100 times more derivative gain than proportional gain
* Good starting value for the integrator gain is to set it smaller than the proportional gain by the same ratio as proportional gain to derivative gain (not using derivative gain, a good starting value for the integrator gain will be around 1/100 of the proportional gain)
