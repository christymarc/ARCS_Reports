## PID Without a PHD

Notes:
* Control loops:  Some command is given to a controller, and the controller determines a drive signal to be applied to the plant. In response to being driven, the plant responds with some behavior. In a closed-loop control system such as a PID loop, the plant behavior is measured, and this measurement is fed back to the controller, which uses it along with the command to determine the plant drive.
* control system's “step response”: the behavior of the system output in response to an input that goes from zero to some constant value at time t = 0
  * step response of motor: starts out slowly due to the time constant, but once that is out of the way the motor position ramps at a constant velocity

  * step response of precision actuator (a freely moving mechanical stage, a speaker coil (a coil and magnet arrangement) and a non-contact position transducer): shaped like a parabola -- sluggishness with which the stage starts moving, and its enthusiasm to keep moving once it gets going

  * step response of heating system:  The response tends to settle out to a constant temperature for a given drive but it can take a great deal of time doing it and has responses to ambient temperature which move the temperature of the system up

* PID = "Proportional, Integral, Derivative"
  * The plant feedback is subtracted from the command signal to generate an error. This error signal drives the proportional and integral elements. The derivative element is driven only from plant feedback.
