# Activities

# Issues
* ue5env not importing because matplotlib wasn't downloaded in conda env 
  * solution: installed matplotlib to env
* ue5env unable to work with ue5 project -> project is receiving requests but not returning them to terminal
  * made some changes with ue5env to resolve initial connection issues but getting following error when calling functions:
  ERROR:__init__:336:Can not receive a response from server, timeout after 5.00 seconds
