# Activities
* ue5env downloaded
   * made edits to code to adjust for new change with intializing client object
   * to use/check in terminal:
      * from ue5env import UE5EnvWrapper
      * ue5 = UE5EnvWrapper()
      * then can use any function from ue5env with object names ue5
    
* boxnav data collection -> ask questions as going through setup and add instructions to readme
    * Notes: 
      * in boxunreal -> initializing UE5EnvWrapper not working because you specify port:
        * TypeError: UE5EnvWrapper.__init__() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given
      
* message Simon to go through codebase, data collection + training + inference process

# Issues
* ue5env not importing because matplotlib wasn't downloaded in conda env 
  * solution: installed matplotlib to env
* ue5env unable to work with ue5 project -> project is receiving requests but not returning them to terminal
  * made some changes with ue5env to resolve initial connection issues (wanted client instead of Client and isconnected instead of is_connected()) but getting following error when calling functions: ERROR: Can not receive a response from server, timeout after 5.00 seconds
  * attempts: Tried specifying a port like this issue (https://github.com/unrealcv/unrealcv/issues/80) suggests
    * results in: ERROR: No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it
    * similar thing occured when i had attempted to follow instructions here (https://compusciencing.github.io/unrealcv-ue5-windows.html)
  * Solution: UE5 must be in PLAY mode
  * Note: might have issue with port being in use: if so -> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39632667/how-do-i-kill-the-process-currently-using-a-port-on-localhost-in-windows and close+reopen ue5
