# Activities

* boxnav data collection -> ask questions as going through setup and add instructions to readme
* message Simon to go through codebase, data collection + training + inference process

# Issues
* ue5env not importing because matplotlib wasn't downloaded in conda env 
  * solution: installed matplotlib to env
* ue5env unable to work with ue5 project -> project is receiving requests but not returning them to terminal
  * made some changes with ue5env to resolve initial connection issues but getting following error when calling functions:
  ERROR:__init__:336:Can not receive a response from server, timeout after 5.00 seconds
  * attempts: Tried specifying a port like this issue (https://github.com/unrealcv/unrealcv/issues/80) suggests
    * results in: ERROR:__init__:174:Error [WinError 10061] No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it
    * similar thing occured when i had attempted to follow instructions here (https://compusciencing.github.io/unrealcv-ue5-windows.html)
