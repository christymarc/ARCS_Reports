# Activities

* Helped Oliver finish imitate.py to enable running/testing of previous-CMD and RNN models
  * Saw seemingly decent performance with RNN (even when trained on different arrow texture)
* Cut spacers for CAD camera stand; put together the stand
* Laid out and ziptied roboclaw robot parts to acrylic sheet
* Went through and added comments to all my code
* Narrowed down cmd models with different architectures for testing
* Began writing script to automatically train classification models with different architectures
* Attempted to connect Jetson and Roboclaw

# Issues

* Normal Learner class in FastAI doesn't have a way of saving confusion matrices to png files 
 * As a work around I had to make my own confusion matrix using SkLearn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn

# Plans

* Still need to finish script to automatically train classification models with different architectures (make input taken from command line and find out how to get training/validation loss)
* Continue working with the robot prototype (get to run via remote connection)
